## Pre-requisites

- **Ruby** - You will need at least version: 2.7.0, we use [RVM](https://rvm.io/) to manage different versions of Ruby.
- **Postgres** - We use Postgres for our database, install it locally on Mac OSX with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Once installed you can run `brew services start postgresql`.
- **Redis** - Install a redis server locally with `brew install redis` and then run `brew services start redis` to get it up and running.

## Getting started

1. Git clone the repo to your local machine
2. Change into the directory with `cd tfl_graph`
3. `bundle install` to install ruby dependencies.
4. `yarn install` to install frontend depenencies.
5. `db:create && db:migrate && db:seed` builds the database, runs initial migrations and seeds the database
6. To run the app use a process manager like [hivemind](https://github.com/DarthSim/hivemind) to run the app locally from the development Procfile `hivemind Procfile.dev`. This mirrors how the app will run in production on Heroku.

## Security

This project uses [brakeman](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman) to detect potential security vulnerabilities. Run `brakeman` in the root of the project to do a security scan.

## Tests

We use [rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) for automated tests. Run the test suite with `bundle exec rspec` from the project root.
